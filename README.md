# Image-Captioning
Designed and implemented a Neural Network architecture that describes the content of images and retrieves them solely based on the generated descriptions. The main objective of is caption generation for the image input. Used CNN and transfer learning for feature extraction from images and LSTM with attention for sequence of words as caption for the image. One of the important constraint of our project was to produce the image descriptions similar to human generated language. We were able to achieve that increase in information exchange in the generated descriptions.
